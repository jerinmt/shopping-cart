The project will be to make a shopping site with a shopping cart implementation.

The project will have a homepage, from which a user can navigate to different categories of products and also to the shopping cart.

The category pages will contain cards of products with a photo, description and price. It will also have a button to toggle adding and removing the product to the shopping cart and to select the quantity.

Whenever a product is added to shopping cart from any category page, it will be automatically added to the single shopping cart, which shows the item list and the total price. User will be able to remove items from the shopping cart as well as change the quantity. There will be a checkout button in the shopping cart page and it will show a dummy message that the order has been placed.

There will be a home page and a category page which shows different categories utilising the 'outlet' element. The third page will be the shopping cart.

The main steps for development are as follows:
1) Find the type of products to focus on using the fakeproducts api or similar ones.
2) Create the home page with links to category page and the shopping cart.
3) Create the categories page with a sidemenu to choose few categories, that show the product cards.
4) Create the shopping cart page.
